                                 PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

As part of the Data Representation and Querying project I chose to create an application for albums called ‘The Archive’. The application contains an API database of basic album information such as the album name, album image and the artist of the album.
The applications consist of components such as home, genre, library, search and article. The frontend and backend of the application were focused on the most. That was where most of the logic and mechanics were. The files for these components also contain commentary on how code had been implemented and how the application runs.

The application performs the full CRUD operations. Most of the project requirements were met. I ran into some issues throughout the project, they were all solved in due time. The major issue was that towards the end I would focus on the design and content for the application but I had realised that once the project turned into one single-page application updates and changes cannot be made as easily. Instead, there is a work-around where the content can be viewed from localhost port:3000. Otherwise, the rest of the project is saved in localhost port:4000.
The full list of data array can be accessed from ‘blob.txt’

The concept of the application is to acknowledge music albums. As there is so much easy access for music in general, there is less appreciation for the body of work that is the album. Hence why the ‘Library’ contains the album image, artist and the title.
